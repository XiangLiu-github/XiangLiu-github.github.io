As one of my two research agendas involves improving the tools we use to study peace and conflict, a good deal of my time is spent using statistical software. Below you'll find software for working with estimates from Bayesian models and some code that I've written to save time on tasks that I find myself doing over and over again.

# Code one

Release code for paper entitled "Significant reductions in crop yields from air pollution and heat stress in the United States"
