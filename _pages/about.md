Hello and welcome! I am a PhD student specializing in climate change, air pollution, and agriculture working with Professor [Peter Huybers](https://phuybers.sites.fas.harvard.edu/) in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I obtained my master's degree at the School of Atmospheric Sciences, [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University). I received my B.Eng. in Environmental Engineering from the [China University of Mining and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_University_of_Mining_and_Technology).

My research interests involve using machine learning tools and causal inference techniques to study the impact of atmospheric environmental factors, such as air pollution and climate change, on plant and human health outcomes and to examine the interactions between climate and agriculture. I primarily use the programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for my research and am particularly passionate about working with *[tidy data](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)*.

I have had my academic work published or forthcoming in *Earth's Future*, *Geophysical Research Letters*, and *Nature Food*. My research covers a range of topics, including assessing the impact of air pollution and heat stress on crop yield in the U.S., utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning methods to study the global distribution of ozone, and examining the effects of air quality policies on China's food security. I employ a variety of methods, such as statistical learning, geospatial analysis, and big data analysis.

Please check out my [publications](publications) to learn more about my work.
