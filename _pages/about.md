Welcome! I am an atmospheric environment researcher pursuing a master's degree at
the School of Atmospheric Sciences, [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University). I earned my B.Eng. in
Environmental Engineering from [China University of Mining and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_University_of_Mining_and_Technology).
I am interested in applying machine learning tools and causal inference techniques
to plant and human health outcomes with atmospheric environment fields e.g., air pollution, and climate change.
I use *[R](https://cran.r-project.org/)* to do my most research, and I am a *[tidy data](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)* fan and enthusiast.

My academic work has been [published](publications) or forthcoming in *Earth's Future*,
*Geophysical Research Letters*, and *Nature Food*. These prior researches explored
how much crop yield has been damaged by air pollution and heat stress in the U.S.,
how to use state-of-the-art machine learning methods to upscale the surface measurements
to a global survey of ozone distribution, and what degree of China's food security would
be enhanced by improved air quality policies. I used a broad variety of methods such as 
statistical learning, geospatial analysis, and big data.
