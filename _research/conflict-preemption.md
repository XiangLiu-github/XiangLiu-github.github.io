Agriculture is facing the unprecedented risk of climate change. Feeding the world population requires coping with emerging global warming and extreme events. In the meantime, because of fossil fuel combustion, the human system has emitted tons of air pollution precursors. Irrespective of air pollutants (ozone and aerosols) adversely impacting human health, they also substantially influence vegetation. Moreover, considering the compound drivers of crop yields, such as heat and ozone episodes, the crop failure may have been larger than previously thought. 

To fully account for the aforementioned factors, we made a wide collection of data in the U.S., including statistics, climate, and air pollution, and merge them into a panel dataset. Then, we built a regression model to investigate the relationships between these variables and crop yields. This model also contains the fixed effect for projecting out the invariant factors in counties as well as common trends in agricultural practice. More importantly, we find that climate and air pollution interactions are vitally essential to crop yields. Our results suggest that we could improve crop yield through air pollution mitigation, and reduce the damage from the interactive effects of air pollutants and climate change.

"Significant Reductions in Crop Yields From Air Pollution and Heat Stress in the United States", *Earth's Future*.

> The joint exposure of plants to surface ozone, atmospheric aerosols, and heat stress can lead to considerable decreases in crop yields. Surface ozone negatively impacts plant photosynthesis while aerosols can have positive or negative effects from its dual impact on light and temperature. Here, using a statistical model, we show that in the United States, as a result of improvements in air quality, the damages caused by ozone and aerosols have decreased since 1980. Historically, relative yield losses due to ozone were 8.7% and 4.8%, and due to aerosols were 11.3% and 23.2% for maize and soybean, respectively. Maize yields are more sensitive to ozone pollution while soybean yields are more sensitive to aerosol pollution. In future RCP 8.5 scenario, absent significant reductions in emissions or improvements in air quality, maize, and soybean would have on average, 58.5% and 36.9% additional yield reductions, respectively, mainly caused by warming. Future climate warming and fossil fuel combustion driven changes to air pollution may have differing impacts on crop yield and should be jointly considered in any assessment of U.S. food security.
