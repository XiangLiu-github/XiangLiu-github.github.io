In this set of projects, I leverage geospatial event data to explore the microlevel dynamics of political violence. What role can violence at the local level serve in advancing broader political ends? What explains patterns of action and reaction between actors engaged in different types of political violence? How do the differing roles the UN peacekeepers play affect the likelihood that rebel fighters will target them?

"Cluster-Enhanced Ensemble Learning for Mapping Global Monthly Surface Ozone From 2003 to 2019", *Geophysical Research Letters*.

> Surface ozone is damaging to human health and crop yields. When evaluating global air pollution risk, gridded datasets with high accuracy are desired to reflect the local variations in air pollution concentrations. Here, a cluster-enhanced ensemble machine learning method was used to develop a new 0.5-degree monthly surface ozone data set during 2003â€“2019 by combining numerous informative variables. The overall accuracy of our data set is 91.5% (90.8% for space and 92.3% for time). Historically, populations in South Asia, North Africa and Middle-East, and High-income North America are exposed to the highest ozone concentrations. Globally, the population weighted ozone concentration in the peak season is 47.07 ppbv. Our results highlight that ozone pollution is intensifying in some regions, and implicate air quality management is crucial to secure human health from air pollution.
